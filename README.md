As an intern at Pinnacle Labs, I am thrilled to announce the completion of my project on the Detection of Road Lane Lines. This journey has been one of immense growth and learning, as I delved into the intricacies of computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques. Through meticulous experimentation and collaboration with mentors, I have successfully developed a robust system capable of accurately identifying and delineating lane lines on road images. This achievement not only showcases my dedication to mastering the craft of data science but also underscores Pinnacle Labs' commitment to fostering innovation and excellence within its intern community. I am grateful for the invaluable guidance and support received throughout this endeavor, and I look forward to applying these newfound skills to future projects at Pinnacle Labs.----TASK-3.
